### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to code and solve problems.

Check out my current hobby project "Hotwired". It is a full stack project hosted in aws behind an nginx reverse proxy. There is a main site and an admin dashboard. Mostly focused on the admin features so far for account management (admin and site accounts).

```javascript
const dallinca = {
  currentProject: {
    name: HotwiredGaming,
    tech: [Javascript, Vue, Vuex, Vue-router, HTML, CSS, JWT, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, Express, Aws, Ec2, Nginx, Gmail-Api, Git, Github],
    status: Under-Construction
  },
  work: {
    pega: {
      current: true,
      position: Technical-Support-Engineer,
      tech: [Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Pega-Platform, Browser-Accessibility]
    },
    oracle: {
      position: Technical-Support-Engineer,
      tech: [Java, Javascript, Knockout, React, Vue, Node, Express, HTML, CSS, Less, Oracle-Commerce, Oracle-Cloud-Infrastructure]
    },
    virtel: {
      position: Technical-Cofounder,
      tech: [C#, Unity, Python, Git, HTC-VIVE, Oculus-Rift, Oculus-Go]
    },
    byu: {

      tech: [php, Wordpress, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, JQuery, Git, Bitbucket]
    }
  },
  school: {

    tools: [Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Angular, Vue, Aws, Ec2, Git, Github],
